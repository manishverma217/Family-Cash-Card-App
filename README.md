# What Will We Build?
Family Cash Card Application
Building a simple Family Cash Card application â€” a modern way for parents to manage allowance funds for their kiddos.
Parents often find themselves lacking an easy way to manage (i.e. send, receive, track) allowances for their kids. So instead of handing out a stack of bills, our cloud-based Family Cash Card app allows parents to virtually manage "cash cards" for their kiddos. You can think of the cash card being very similar to a gift card that many of us send and receive. The primary goal of the Family Cash Card app is to give parents ease and control over managing funds for their children.
We'll use Spring Boot to progress from creating a single cash card in a database to allowing for the editing, deleting, and viewing of multiple cash cards, and finally securing your app against unauthorized access and unwanted exploits.
# What Will We Use?
1) Utilize Spring Boot to build a complete RESTful API while understanding the benefits and tradeoffs of REST.
2) Learn what Spring Boot offers to application developers and how it differs from the Spring Framework.
3) Build Web applications with Spring Web.
4) Use Spring Data to connect databases and map relational data to Java objects.
5) Use Spring Security to develop software with a Security First approach.
